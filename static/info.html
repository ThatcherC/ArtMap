				<p>Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the modern Olympic Games in 1896 and began organizing the <b style="color:black">Olympic Art Competitions</b> ten years later. The IOC resolved to create five contests--a <q>Pentathlon of the Muses</q>--in architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. Every four years, competitors would submit <b style="color:black">artworks based on sport</b> or inspired by Olympic ideas.</p>
			
				<p>Coubertin submitted <q><b style="color:black">Ode to Sport</b></q> to the first contest in <b style="color:black">Stockholm in 1912</b> under two pseudonyms and two languages: French and German. The jury awarded him the gold over better-known writers like Gabriele d&#39Annunzio, but it had reservations about the bilingual model: <q>It&#39s preferable for presented works to carry the mark of a national genius and not to try to cross borders.</q></p>

				<p>As such, the <b style="color:black">gold was given to Germany</b>, rather than both nations. And although future artists would sometimes win Olympic medals in pairs or groups, the groups were never international, in spite of Coubertin&#39s hopeful example.</p>
