				<h3><center>From 1912 to 1948, artists could win Olympic medals in five major events. More than 2,000 tried. Only 45 took gold.</center></h3>
			  	<p>The Olympic Art Competitions were official events at the Olympic Games from 1912 to 1948. Known to their founder as the <q>Pentathlon of the Muses,</q> these contests awarded medals in architecture, music, literature, painting, and sculpture for works about sport. Over seven Olympiads in seven cities, more than 2,000 artists participated from around the world.</p>
				<p>The Olympic ArtMap allows us to visualize that participation. Using data from over 3,000 submissions, this interactive map tracks Olympic artworks&#39 origins, destinations, and success. What we discover are not just the statistics of a single competition, but global trends illustrating one of the most complex periods in art history--the decades of modernism--in new and surprising ways.</p>
