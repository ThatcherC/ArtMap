			  <h2><b><u>Creative Team</u></b></h2>

			  <p> <b>Thatcher Chamberlin</b> is a sophomore studying Physics at MIT. He also has a background in computer programming and web design, having built a number of websites using technologies similar to those used in this project. His role in the project was to help with the design of the project&#39s map functionality and the website backend.</p>

			  <p><b>Kelsey DeJesus-Banos</b> is a 1st-year Master of Electrical Engineering at Harvard mainly focusing on Computer Graphics. Having mainly worked with software before, she has dedicated herself to the programming and technical portions of the project working both on the front- and back-end of the website.</p>

			   <p><b>Miles Osgood</b> is a 4th-year PhD student in English at Harvard. The data for this project comes from research on his dissertation, <q>Olympism: The Olympic Art Competitions and Athletic Modernism.</q> The dissertation as a whole considers the interest in sport among modern artists and writers in the early twentieth-century, by way of the 1912-1948 Olympic contests; this DH project focuses mostly on the Olympic half, as a way to visualize forms of international circulation and competition in the arts in this period.</p>
			  <p><b>Ece Turnator</b> is a Humanities and Digital Scholarship Librarian at MIT.</p>
				
			  <p><b>Yuchuan Zhang</b> is a 1st-year Master of Architecture in Urban Design Student at Harvard. As a student with the design background, she mainly gives advice and sketches for the layout of the website and for data visualization. She also works on user experience in the design of the ArtMap.</p>

			  <h2><b><u>Acknowledgements</u></b></h2>
			  <p>This website was created at MIT for CMS 633/833: Digital Humanities. We would like to thank Prof. Kurt Fendt and our classmates for their invaluable feedback over the course of this project. We also thank Derek Miller and Jacqueline Basu for helping to acquire and organize the Olympic arts metadata.<p>

			  <p>Most of the metadata comes from <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/">sports-reference.com</a>. We&#39ve cross-referenced this metadata with information in Olympic reports and exhibition catalogues, making slight corrections and additions, and (most importantly) we&#39ve manually added artists&#39 home cities based on the addresses they supplied to the competition organizers. Sports-reference.com generously encourages use of its data as <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/data_use.html"> factual information outside of copyright</a>, but we still want to acknowledge its collection efforts and its artist biographies, without which this project wouldn&#39t be possible.</p>
