Descended from an Irish family, he was an avid and versatile sportsman. His childhood friend Max Schmitt taught him the German language. Eakins caused several scandals by his penchant for nudes, in a time of very prudish America. Today he is considered one of the most important and most expensive painters of the United States before World War II. The art historian Henry Adams described Thomas Eakins in 2005 as the Michael Jackson of his time, because he also was guilty of serious misconducts such as anti-Semitism, bestiality, exhibitionism, incest, lies, sadism, poor writing style, sexism, unattractiveness and voyeurism. His paintings were posthumously submitted to the 1932 art competition. Although Eakins was married three times, it is still unclear whether he was heterosexual or homosexual. What is known about some of his friends and students is that they were gay, but it was never confirmed that he himself was gay. In some of his works homosexual motives can be identified.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/olympics\/athletes\/ea\/thomas-eakins-1.html"}, {"ARTIST ID":"alexander-tiranoff-1","BIO":"","URL":"http:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/olympics\/athletes\/ti\/alexander-tiranoff-1.html"}, {"ARTIST ID":"yvonne-meley-1","BIO":"","URL":"http:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/olympics\/athletes\/me\/yvonne-meley-1.html"}, {"ARTIST ID":"jerzy-bandura-1","BIO":"Jerzy Bandura studied in Krakw.

During the winter of 1922-23 Merrild created a body of work relating to New Mexico and later wrote a book about his experiences with D. H. Lawrence, A Poet and Two Painters, which was first published in 1939 and made him well-known.  In 1923, Merrild went to Los Angeles for the next 30 years. There he created his most significant work, an output of several hundred works in a range of styles. Merrild's early works were cubist inspired paintings and watercolors. He later experimented with different materials in an effort to create works with three-dimensional outputs. His works were mostly described as surrealistic and were included in recent survey exhibitions dealing with Surrealism in the United States. In 1942 he developed a totally new technique of painting which he called \"flux\", a process by which he alternatively poured or dripped paints onto a fluid surface. In some cases, the resulting works were entirely abstract while in others, concrete images could be recognized.  In 1952 Merrild suffered a heart attack and returned to his native country seeking less expensive medical care. He did not produce any more work in Denmark and died in 1954.

It was a drawing of a magnificent and ornate, yet fairly useless, machine for cleaning out holes in golf courses. Many of his works were along these lines hence, when you hear the expression It is Heath Robinson, it is a phrase meaning\\: \"An absurdly ingenious and impracticable device\" and the expression entered the English language in 1912. Robinson must be one of the few, if not only Olympian to have an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary named after them. Heath Robinson was born into a family of artists as he and his brothers Charles and Thomas followed in the footsteps of their father Thomas, Sr., who was a writer, artist and chief illustrator for the Penny Illustrated Paper and they had an uncle who worked on the Illustrated London News. Another of Robinsons brothers, George, was a publishers manager. Robinson studied at the Islington Art College and then the Royal Academy. He had wanted to be a landscape artist but his career started as a book illustrator and his early works included including Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales. He then obtained commissions working for the magazines Tatler and The Sketch which eventually took him into drawing cartoons of weird contraptions. One of the many contraptions he drew was a camera to enable a person to take a photograph of themselves. And who said the selfie was a modern-day thing? Despite his elaborate designs, Robinson was not an engineer and it is doubtful that any of his creations would actually have worked. His work was not entirely restricted to the drawing of weird and wonderful contraptions. He made scenery for the Alhambra and Empire theatres in London, provided murals for the Knickerbocker Bar and the childrens room on the cruise liner the Empress of Britain. Robinson had four sons and a daughter. Three of his sons, Quentin, Oliver and Tom all served in the Army in the second World War, while his daughter Joan was a nurse. His fourth son Alan was a monk.

He studied in Genoa and then moved to Milano. He soon began to sculpt in clay (terra cotta) and other media. In the 1930s, his sculptures were exhibited throughout Europe in group shows of Italian artists. In 1932, he moved to Milano, and was soon appointed a tenured professor at the Brera Art Academy. One of his best known works is the Dying Horse at the entrance to the Italian public broadcaster RAI in Rome. His daughter Paola also became a sculptor. Messinas association with the Fascist Party (he was a long-time member) during World War II may have been a simple question of opportunism, since it facilitated his receiving public appointments and public commissions. His association was sufficient to bring about a brief post-war suspension as director of the Brera Academy. His art was rarely political, but after World War II occasionally dealt with themes like war and violence. Messina was little known outside Italy, though his commissioned works can still be seen in a number of countries, and he sometimes exhibited internationally.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/olympics\/athletes\/me\/francesco-messina-1.html"}, {"ARTIST ID":"arthur-wellmann-1","BIO":"","URL":"http:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/olympics\/athletes\/we\/arthur-wellmann-1.html"}, {"ARTIST ID":"julius-paulsen-1","BIO":"Julius Paulsen won early attention in the Danish art world.

His reign was the most controversial of any IOC President.  He served during a very difficult, tumultuous time politically, but his autocratic methods won him few friends. Avery Brundage was born on 28 September 1887 in Detroit, Michigan, but his family moved to Chicago when he was young.  He attended the University of Illinois, graduating with a civil engineering degree in 1909.  While in college he competed on the track & field team, winning the conference discus championship in his senior year.  After college, Brundage worked as a construction superintendent in Chicago.  Using borrowed money he was able to start his own construction company in 1915, an enterprise at which he was eminently successful and which made him a wealthy man. But Brundage continued competing in track & field athletics after college.  He joined the Chicago Athletic Association in 1910 and specialized in the all-around event, a 10-event competition that was a precursor to the decathlon.  With his all-around talents, Brundage qualified for the 1912 U.S. Olympic team in both the decathlon and pentathlon.  He finished 5th in the pentathlon at Stockholm but did not finish the decathlon.  He was the first IOC President to have actually competed in the Olympic Games.  Continuing to compete even after forming his own company, Brundage eventually won three national championships in the all-around  in 1914, 1916, and 1918. When his track & field career wound down, Brundage turned to handball (the American individual version) and became one of the best individual players in Chicago.  By the mid-1920s, Brundage had already made a fortune in the construction business, allowing him the freedom to pursue sports administration, and handball was the sport in which his avocation began.  After working for several years with the Central Association of the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union), he served as chairman of the national handball committee of the AAU from 1925 to 1927.  In 1928 he was elected president of both the AAU (serving until the fall of 1935, except for 1933) and its Olympic arm, the American Olympic Association (AOA), the forerunner of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC).  He continued as President of the American Olympic Association, and its successor organizations, until his election as IOC President in 1952. Brundage benefited politically from the furor over the proposed American boycott of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.  A staunch believer that sport should be kept apart from politics, Brundage took the pro-participation stance.  One of the American IOC Members, [Ernest Lee Jahncke], supported the boycott, which met with great disfavor from the IOC.  In an extremely close vote of delegates at the AAU convention held at the Commodore Hotel in New York City in December 1935, Brundage's point of view prevailed, and the Americans agreed to participate in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.  In June 1936, [Charles Sherrill], one of the other U.S. IOC Members, died.  Almost concurrently, Jahncke was ousted from the IOC because of his stance in favor of boycotting the Berlin Olympics.  Brundage was the obvious choice to move onto the IOC and he was confirmed at the 35th IOC Session in Berlin in July 1936.  Within one year, Brundage was named to the Executive Board of the IOC. Brundage himself also took part in the 1936 Olympics, entering the art competitions, which he had also done four years earlier. When IOC President [Henri de Baillot-Latour] died in 1942, the Swede, [Sigfrid Edstrm], stood in as de facto President until the end of World War II.  One of his first actions was to appoint Brundage as Vice-President.  Together, Edstrm and Brundage kept the IOC together by letters written to the members throughout the world.  In 1946, at the first post-war IOC Session, Edstrm was chosen as IOC President by acclamation.  He then appointed his friend, Avery Brundage, 1st Vice-President.  In 1952, when Edstrm stepped down as IOC President, Avery Brundage was elected President of the IOC in a very close vote over [David, Lord Burghley], of Great Britain, a former Olympic gold medalist in the 400 metre hurdles. Brundage's term as IOC President was a difficult one politically for the IOC.  The IOC was faced by the question of the two Germanies, the two Koreas, the two Chinas, the apartheid problem in sport in South Africa and Rhodesia, rising problems with professional encroachment on the Olympic Movement, political demonstrations by American blacks, and finally, in the last days of his term, by the horrible massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in Munich at the 1972 Olympics.  Fortunately to some and unfortunately to others, these problems were addressed almost solely by Brundage, who believed in an autocratic, one-person rule of the IOC, who had little diplomatic skills, and who knew nothing of the word compromise.  His mores were anachronistic and he refused to admit that any of his 19th century ideals could be wrong. Brundage was proud of the way in which the two Germany question was handled.  Early on, the IOC was able to get the two German states to enter a combined team, and Brundage crowed, We have succeeded where the politicians could not.  But East Germany continued to press for independent representation at the Olympics and eventually this was granted.  Concerning the two Koreas, Brundage also brokered a compromise in which a combined Korean team would compete, but this never occurred as the two Korean states refused to do so.  Brundage never made any inroads into solving the problem of the two Chinas, leaving that situation to his successors, [Killanin] and [Samaranch], who were eventually able to produce a solution. South Africa vexed Brundage and the IOC throughout his term of office.  South Africa was eventually evicted from the IOC and the Olympic Movement in the 1970s because of apartheid and, in particular, its use of apartheid in choosing its Olympic teams.  South Africa would not return to the Olympic fold until 1991, after the fall of apartheid as a political system.  Similar problems confronted Brundage in regard to Rhodesia, which led to a small boycott of the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Brundage was enraged by this and it later led him, during the memorial ceremony for the Israeli hostages in Munich, to compare the African boycott of Munich to the Israeli massacres, a comment so inappropriate that it evoked outrage from many and brought only contempt for Brundage from even his closest allies, including Lord Killanin, who was to succeed him as President in just six days. Brundage believed in amateurism, pure and simple, with no possible compromise allowed.  He was especially bothered by the Olympic Winter Games, in which the alpine skiiers openly flaunted advertising on their skis, and many of them were known to be closet professionals.  Brundage even proposed canceling the Olympic Winter Games because of the creeping professionalism, or at least canceling the alpine skiing events, often considered the highlight of the Olympic Winter program.  In 1972 he succeeded in the token banning of Austria's [Karl Schranz] as a professional.  Schranz was a favorite to win several medals and his ouster outraged the Austrian team, who stated that many skiiers were being paid by ski companies.  Brundage commented that Schranz was the worst and refused to reinstate him. Avery Brundage stepped down as IOC President after the Munich Olympics in 1972.  Shortly thereafter, he married a much younger German woman whom he had met during his Olympic travels.  Despite his self-righteous moral stands, it was later revealed that he had fathered at least one child out of wedlock, while married to his first wife, but never admitted it.  After retirement from the IOC, he lived only a few more years, dying in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, on 7 May 1975.

Three years later he married the journalist and writer Ilse Frank. In 1910, after working for two years with the firm of Peter Behrens, Gropius started his own business as a designer and architect without having achieved a degree, bringing with him fellow Behrens employee Adolf Meyer. In the 1920s his idiosyncratic style was called \"New Construction \/ New Objectivity\". Like no one else, he influenced the design of industrial goods and is considered one of the pioneers of modern architecture. After the 1st World War, Gropius took over the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar (later Dessau), which became the Bauhaus School. He acted as its director from 1919-28, and is considered the leader of the Bauhaus Movement. Subsequently, he designed numerous residential projects like the Siemensstadt in Berlin. In 1934 Gropius escaped from the Nazis, first to Great Britain, and then in 1937 to the United States, living in a suburb of Boston  Lincoln, Massachusetts. His ideas were later the basis for prefabricated housing in satellite towns of many major cities. Gropius taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and became a naturalized US citizen in 1944. In 1945 he co-founded The Architects Collaborative in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which became one of the most respected architectural firms in the world for the next 50 years, although the firm dissolved in bankruptcy in 1995. In 1967 Gropius became an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design and was elected a full member in 1968. After World War II Gropius returned to Berlin and planned, amongst others, the so-called Gropiusstadt.

Although recent scholarship has shown that he was not the only person who had the idea to begin international Olympic Games, he is certainly the person still mostly responsible for the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896.  For this effort, he is correctly termed le rnovateur. Born in Paris as Pierre Frdy, he was descended from a noble line which had lived in France for over 500 years.  After his preliminary studies he entered law school in 1884 although he never intended to practice law, and he left after one year, enrolling instead in the cole libre de sciences politiques.  Coubertin had early on decided that his goal would be the reform of the French educational system.  He based this reform on ideas he had gleaned from visits to England, observing their educational system, the first of which occurred in 1883. From England, Coubertin learned of Thomas Arnolds theory about the principal element in English male education: sports.  Arnold had become headmaster of Rugby school in 1828 and, although not an innovator in teaching methods, his aim was to reform Rugby school by making it a school for gentlemen.  Coubertin studied his system of school sports, student self-government, and post-graduate athletic associations, and hoped to incorporate them into the French educational system.  During the 1880s school sport competitions started in Paris.  For the first time, high school students played football (soccer).  Shortly thereafter, the Racing Club de France was founded, with Coubertin as an officer of the club.  In 1888 Coubertin published the results of his studies on the British educational system, which were more or less a reflection of Arnolds theories.  Coubertin next formed a committee designed to be responsible for physical education in schools.  The committee was mostly run by Coubertin, but found little support among the French public. In July 1889 Coubertin traveled to the United States and Canada to visit several universities, colleges, and high schools, to examine the structure of North American educational systems and sporting organizations.  On his return Coubertin traveled again to England where he met William Penny Brookes, who had started a series of sporting festivals in rural England, which he called the Much Wenlock Olympian Games.  From Brookes, Coubertin also learned of a series of sporting festivals in Athens, termed the Zappas Olympic Games. Spurred by these findings, and hearing of multiple archaeological discoveries in ancient Olympia between 1875 and 1881, Coubertin became enthralled with the idea of re-establishing the Olympic Games as a modern international sporting festival.  In studying the ancient Olympics, Coubertin thought that at least one reason for the flowering of Greece during the so-called Golden Age had been sport and the ideal of the Olympic Games.  In November 1892 Coubertin organized a conference at the Sorbonne in which he discussed the history of sports and the possibility of renewing the Olympic Games.  At this conference he made his now famous proposal, Let us export rowers, runners, and fencers; there is the free trade of the future, and on the day when it is introduced within the walls of old Europe the cause of peace will have received a new mighty stay.  This is enough to encourage your servant to dream now about the second part of his program: he hopes that you will help him as you have helped him hitherto, and that with you he will be able to continue and complete, on a basis suited to the conditions of modern life, this grandiose and salutary task, the restoration of the Olympic Games.  But his message fell on deaf ears.  There was no support for the idea in France. Coubertin refused to give up.  He arranged another conference at the Sorbonne for June 1894, this time inviting a more international gathering of delegates.  The theme of the conference was ostensibly to discuss the role of amateurism in sport, but Coubertin secretly had planned to broach the idea of reviving the Olympic Games once again, a topic which he added to the end of the program.  And he was finally successful.  The delegates voted to re-establish the Olympic Games as an international sporting festival, and to begin the festival in 1896 in Athens.  In addition, the conference formed the International Olympic Committee to oversee the Olympic Games. Coubertin felt that the President of the IOC should reside in the nation hosting the next Olympic Games, thus he established [Demetrios Vikelas] in this post.  But with the 1900 Olympic Games scheduled for Coubertins hometown of Paris, Coubertin took over as President of the IOC in 1896, and remained in the post until he voluntarily resigned in 1925.  For those 29 years, he was the International Olympic Committee, and the Olympic Movement.  Most of the philosophy of Olympism, the structure of the Olympic Movement, and many of the major ideas of the Olympic Games came through him.  He had little help, not establishing an Executive Board to assist him in decisions until 1921.  In addition, much of the money used to run the IOC, and publish material related to the committee and the Olympic Games, came from Coubertins personal fortune.  Sadly, he greatly depleted this fortune in the effort, and struggled financially in the last years of his life, as did his widow, who survived him by over 30 years. Coubertin published copiously during his lifetime, and wrote extensively on the idea of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement.  Much of the philosophy of Olympism is derived from his writings, although Coubertin defined that philosophy in several different ways.  For him, it consisted of internationalism, fair play in sports, and sport for all.  Modern sports scholars consider that Coubertin envisioned the Olympic Movement as a peace movement, attempting to bring together the peoples of the world in peaceful competition. The major stain on Coubertins ideals of the Olympic Movement was his attitude towards women in sports.  He never supported the idea at all and openly resisted allowing women to compete at the Olympic Games.  Fortunately the IOC changed this dramatically after he left the IOC in 1925. Coubertin moved the headquarters of the IOC to Lausanne, Switzerland in 1915, and he lived there until his death.  After the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, he never attended another Olympics.  But at Berlin in 1936, his voice was recorded and his famous statement concerning the Olympics was announced to the crowd of over 100,000 at the opening ceremony, The important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part.  Just as in life, the aim is not to conquer but to struggle well. Coubertins personal life outside of the Olympics was not nearly as successful, and it is possible that later in life he used the Olympic idea as an escape from his troubles.  In 1895 he had married Marie Rothan, the daughter of family friends, and they had several happy and successful years.  But their later years were marred by the sad fates of their children.  The first-born, Jacques, became retarded after his parents left him in the sun too long when he was a little child.  Their daughter suffered emotional disturbances, never married, and never found peace in her life.  Marie and Pierre de Coubertin blamed each other and tried to console themselves with two nephews who became substitutes for their own children, but the nephews were killed at the front in World War I, ending the ancient Coubertin line with the death of Pierre de Coubertin. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, le rnovateur of the modern Olympic Games, died while walking in a park in Geneva on 2 September 1937.  He was buried in the Bois de Vaux in Lausanne, almost within sight of the present IOC headquarters, but per the wishes of his last will and testament, his heart was removed from his body and buried near the site of the Ancient Olympic stadium, where it had always been.

During World War II, Nellemose was a member of the Danish resistance group. Therefore, he later received many commissions for war memorials. He also used photographs as templates to represent prisoners from concentration camps in his sculptures. His sister, Karin (190593) was a well-known actress, figuring in many stage productions and films.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/olympics\/athletes\/ne\/knud-nellemose-1.html"}, {"ARTIST ID":"johan-van-hell-1","BIO":"Johan Van Hell was a Dutch visual artist and musician. Even as a young boy he knew that he wanted to combine these two art directions during his lifetime, as he stated: I want to become an artist and a musician and I want to pursue both careers with all my strength.  There then followed periods of almost frantic painting juxtaposed with periods of mostly music making. Beginning in 1909, and throughout his life, he taught both music and art. Both of his wives shared his passion; the first one, Pauline Wijnman, was a skilful artist and the second one, Caroline Lankhout, was a concert pianist. Both wives also shared his devotion to the socialist cause. In music he learned to play clarinet and experimented in music ranging from baroque to jazz. He often played with smaller ensembles and in later years he loved chamber music.  He mostly painted oil portraits of friends and family members, landscapes, and views from his apartment, but some were in watercolor. From 1925 he adopted geometric approaches to show his social messages depicted in the features of the persons he painted. During that time he also produced lithographs. The terrible years before and during WWII  as his second wife had a Jewish father  saw decreased production of his works, but after the war he again produced his captivating art. In 1952 he died after a severe kidney infection complicated by his fragile diabetes.
