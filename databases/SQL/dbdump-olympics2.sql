His reign was the most controversial of any IOC President.  He served during a very difficult, tumultuous time politically, but his autocratic methods won him few friends. Avery Brundage was born on 28 September 1887 in Detroit, Michigan, but his family moved to Chicago when he was young.  He attended the University of Illinois, graduating with a civil engineering degree in 1909.  While in college he competed on the track & field team, winning the conference discus championship in his senior year.  After college, Brundage worked as a construction superintendent in Chicago.  Using borrowed money he was able to start his own construction company in 1915, an enterprise at which he was eminently successful and which made him a wealthy man. But Brundage continued competing in track & field athletics after college.  He joined the Chicago Athletic Association in 1910 and specialized in the all-around event, a 10-event competition that was a precursor to the decathlon.  With his all-around talents, Brundage qualified for the 1912 U.S. Olympic team in both the decathlon and pentathlon.  He finished 5th in the pentathlon at Stockholm but did not finish the decathlon.  He was the first IOC President to have actually competed in the Olympic Games.  Continuing to compete even after forming his own company, Brundage eventually won three national championships in the all-around  in 1914, 1916, and 1918. When his track & field career wound down, Brundage turned to handball (the American individual version) and became one of the best individual players in Chicago.  By the mid-1920s, Brundage had already made a fortune in the construction business, allowing him the freedom to pursue sports administration, and handball was the sport in which his avocation began.  After working for several years with the Central Association of the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union), he served as chairman of the national handball committee of the AAU from 1925 to 1927.  In 1928 he was elected president of both the AAU (serving until the fall of 1935, except for 1933) and its Olympic arm, the American Olympic Association (AOA), the forerunner of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC).  He continued as President of the American Olympic Association, and its successor organizations, until his election as IOC President in 1952. Brundage benefited politically from the furor over the proposed American boycott of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.  A staunch believer that sport should be kept apart from politics, Brundage took the pro-participation stance.  One of the American IOC Members, [Ernest Lee Jahncke], supported the boycott, which met with great disfavor from the IOC.  In an extremely close vote of delegates at the AAU convention held at the Commodore Hotel in New York City in December 1935, Brundage\'s point of view prevailed, and the Americans agreed to participate in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.  In June 1936, [Charles Sherrill], one of the other U.S. IOC Members, died.  Almost concurrently, Jahncke was ousted from the IOC because of his stance in favor of boycotting the Berlin Olympics.  Brundage was the obvious choice to move onto the IOC and he was confirmed at the 35th IOC Session in Berlin in July 1936.  Within one year, Brundage was named to the Executive Board of the IOC. Brundage himself also took part in the 1936 Olympics, entering the art competitions, which he had also done four years earlier. When IOC President [Henri de Baillot-Latour] died in 1942, the Swede, [Sigfrid Edstrm], stood in as de facto President until the end of World War II.  One of his first actions was to appoint Brundage as Vice-President.  Together, Edstrm and Brundage kept the IOC together by letters written to the members throughout the world.  In 1946, at the first post-war IOC Session, Edstrm was chosen as IOC President by acclamation.  He then appointed his friend, Avery Brundage, 1st Vice-President.  In 1952, when Edstrm stepped down as IOC President, Avery Brundage was elected President of the IOC in a very close vote over [David, Lord Burghley], of Great Britain, a former Olympic gold medalist in the 400 metre hurdles. Brundage\'s term as IOC President was a difficult one politically for the IOC.  The IOC was faced by the question of the two Germanies, the two Koreas, the two Chinas, the apartheid problem in sport in South Africa and Rhodesia, rising problems with professional encroachment on the Olympic Movement, political demonstrations by American blacks, and finally, in the last days of his term, by the horrible massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in Munich at the 1972 Olympics.  Fortunately to some and unfortunately to others, these problems were addressed almost solely by Brundage, who believed in an autocratic, one-person rule of the IOC, who had little diplomatic skills, and who knew nothing of the word compromise.  His mores were anachronistic and he refused to admit that any of his 19th century ideals could be wrong. Brundage was proud of the way in which the two Germany question was handled.  Early on, the IOC was able to get the two German states to enter a combined team, and Brundage crowed, We have succeeded where the politicians could not.  But East Germany continued to press for independent representation at the Olympics and eventually this was granted.  Concerning the two Koreas, Brundage also brokered a compromise in which a combined Korean team would compete, but this never occurred as the two Korean states refused to do so.  Brundage never made any inroads into solving the problem of the two Chinas, leaving that situation to his successors, [Killanin] and [Samaranch], who were eventually able to produce a solution. South Africa vexed Brundage and the IOC throughout his term of office.  South Africa was eventually evicted from the IOC and the Olympic Movement in the 1970s because of apartheid and, in particular, its use of apartheid in choosing its Olympic teams.  South Africa would not return to the Olympic fold until 1991, after the fall of apartheid as a political system.  Similar problems confronted Brundage in regard to Rhodesia, which led to a small boycott of the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Brundage was enraged by this and it later led him, during the memorial ceremony for the Israeli hostages in Munich, to compare the African boycott of Munich to the Israeli massacres, a comment so inappropriate that it evoked outrage from many and brought only contempt for Brundage from even his closest allies, including Lord Killanin, who was to succeed him as President in just six days. Brundage believed in amateurism, pure and simple, with no possible compromise allowed.  He was especially bothered by the Olympic Winter Games, in which the alpine skiiers openly flaunted advertising on their skis, and many of them were known to be closet professionals.  Brundage even proposed canceling the Olympic Winter Games because of the creeping professionalism, or at least canceling the alpine skiing events, often considered the highlight of the Olympic Winter program.  In 1972 he succeeded in the token banning of Austria\'s [Karl Schranz] as a professional.  Schranz was a favorite to win several medals and his ouster outraged the Austrian team, who stated that many skiiers were being paid by ski companies.  Brundage commented that Schranz was the worst and refused to reinstate him. Avery Brundage stepped down as IOC President after the Munich Olympics in 1972.  Shortly thereafter, he married a much younger German woman whom he had met during his Olympic travels.

Although recent scholarship has shown that he was not the only person who had the idea to begin international Olympic Games, he is certainly the person still mostly responsible for the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896.  For this effort, he is correctly termed le rnovateur. Born in Paris as Pierre Frdy, he was descended from a noble line which had lived in France for over 500 years.  After his preliminary studies he entered law school in 1884 although he never intended to practice law, and he left after one year, enrolling instead in the cole libre de sciences politiques.  Coubertin had early on decided that his goal would be the reform of the French educational system.  He based this reform on ideas he had gleaned from visits to England, observing their educational system, the first of which occurred in 1883. From England, Coubertin learned of Thomas Arnolds theory about the principal element in English male education: sports.  Arnold had become headmaster of Rugby school in 1828 and, although not an innovator in teaching methods, his aim was to reform Rugby school by making it a school for gentlemen.  Coubertin studied his system of school sports, student self-government, and post-graduate athletic associations, and hoped to incorporate them into the French educational system.  During the 1880s school sport competitions started in Paris.  For the first time, high school students played football (soccer).  Shortly thereafter, the Racing Club de France was founded, with Coubertin as an officer of the club.  In 1888 Coubertin published the results of his studies on the British educational system, which were more or less a reflection of Arnolds theories.  Coubertin next formed a committee designed to be responsible for physical education in schools.  The committee was mostly run by Coubertin, but found little support among the French public. In July 1889 Coubertin traveled to the United States and Canada to visit several universities, colleges, and high schools, to examine the structure of North American educational systems and sporting organizations.  On his return Coubertin traveled again to England where he met William Penny Brookes, who had started a series of sporting festivals in rural England, which he called the Much Wenlock Olympian Games.  From Brookes, Coubertin also learned of a series of sporting festivals in Athens, termed the Zappas Olympic Games. Spurred by these findings, and hearing of multiple archaeological discoveries in ancient Olympia between 1875 and 1881, Coubertin became enthralled with the idea of re-establishing the Olympic Games as a modern international sporting festival.  In studying the ancient Olympics, Coubertin thought that at least one reason for the flowering of Greece during the so-called Golden Age had been sport and the ideal of the Olympic Games.  In November 1892 Coubertin organized a conference at the Sorbonne in which he discussed the history of sports and the possibility of renewing the Olympic Games.  At this conference he made his now famous proposal, Let us export rowers, runners, and fencers; there is the free trade of the future, and on the day when it is introduced within the walls of old Europe the cause of peace will have received a new mighty stay.  This is enough to encourage your servant to dream now about the second part of his program: he hopes that you will help him as you have helped him hitherto, and that with you he will be able to continue and complete, on a basis suited to the conditions of modern life, this grandiose and salutary task, the restoration of the Olympic Games.  But his message fell on deaf ears.  There was no support for the idea in France. Coubertin refused to give up.  He arranged another conference at the Sorbonne for June 1894, this time inviting a more international gathering of delegates.  The theme of the conference was ostensibly to discuss the role of amateurism in sport, but Coubertin secretly had planned to broach the idea of reviving the Olympic Games once again, a topic which he added to the end of the program.  And he was finally successful.  The delegates voted to re-establish the Olympic Games as an international sporting festival, and to begin the festival in 1896 in Athens.  In addition, the conference formed the International Olympic Committee to oversee the Olympic Games. Coubertin felt that the President of the IOC should reside in the nation hosting the next Olympic Games, thus he established [Demetrios Vikelas] in this post.  But with the 1900 Olympic Games scheduled for Coubertins hometown of Paris, Coubertin took over as President of the IOC in 1896, and remained in the post until he voluntarily resigned in 1925.  For those 29 years, he was the International Olympic Committee, and the Olympic Movement.  Most of the philosophy of Olympism, the structure of the Olympic Movement, and many of the major ideas of the Olympic Games came through him.  He had little help, not establishing an Executive Board to assist him in decisions until 1921.  In addition, much of the money used to run the IOC, and publish material related to the committee and the Olympic Games, came from Coubertins personal fortune.  Sadly, he greatly depleted this fortune in the effort, and struggled financially in the last years of his life, as did his widow, who survived him by over 30 years. Coubertin published copiously during his lifetime, and wrote extensively on the idea of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement.  Much of the philosophy of Olympism is derived from his writings, although Coubertin defined that philosophy in several different ways.  For him, it consisted of internationalism, fair play in sports, and sport for all.  Modern sports scholars consider that Coubertin envisioned the Olympic Movement as a peace movement, attempting to bring together the peoples of the world in peaceful competition. The major stain on Coubertins ideals of the Olympic Movement was his attitude towards women in sports.  He never supported the idea at all and openly resisted allowing women to compete at the Olympic Games.  Fortunately the IOC changed this dramatically after he left the IOC in 1925. Coubertin moved the headquarters of the IOC to Lausanne, Switzerland in 1915, and he lived there until his death.  After the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, he never attended another Olympics.  But at Berlin in 1936, his voice was recorded and his famous statement concerning the Olympics was announced to the crowd of over 100,000 at the opening ceremony, The important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part.  Just as in life, the aim is not to conquer but to struggle well. Coubertins personal life outside of the Olympics was not nearly as successful, and it is possible that later in life he used the Olympic idea as an escape from his troubles.  In 1895 he had married Marie Rothan, the daughter of family friends, and they had several happy and successful years.  But their later years were marred by the sad fates of their children.  The first-born, Jacques, became retarded after his parents left him in the sun too long when he was a little child.  Their daughter suffered emotional disturbances, never married, and never found peace in her life.  Marie and Pierre de Coubertin blamed each other and tried to console themselves with two nephews who became substitutes for their own children, but the nephews were killed at the front in World War I, ending the ancient Coubertin line with the death of Pierre de Coubertin. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, le rnovateur of the modern Olympic Games, died while walking in a park in Geneva on 2 September 1937.  He was buried in the Bois de Vaux in Lausanne, almost within sight of the present IOC headquarters, but per the wishes of his last will and testament, his heart was removed from his body and buried near the site of the Ancient Olympic stadium, where it had always been.
