-----------------------------

(1) Cities -> Countries -> Host city
  - Geocoding task
(2) Quantity with color - gray scale
(3) Set up server
  - gcloud compute --project "artmap-165517" ssh --zone "us-central1-c" "artmap-server"
(4) Pop up "bubble" for each year's info
(5) Full metadata on autogenned pages

----------------------------

alter results table so it has a gold, silver, and bronze column

-------------
Proposed flow: select a year and medals and maybe other stuff

Map shows lines from each country to the host city, varying thickness
info window lists countries and medal counts

Click country in map or info window and get entries from that country in the info window

Click an entry to get its info (new page???)

Click an artist to see all their entries (new page)
